title: Assignment 7
---

## Problem

As this assignment is optional for most, I have decided to make it both more
flexible and less guided than the previous assignments. You have three options
to choose from.

1. Pick a Haskell library you think is cool and write a small program using it.
   Some recommendations to check out are `diagrams`, `scotty`, `aeson`,
   `reflex`, `brick`, and `quickcheck`.

1. Pick a chapter from the advanced track of the [Haskell Wiki
   Book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell) *that we have not yet covered*
   and write a small program based on its topic. It can be an extension of code
   given in the chapter, or of your own design.

1. Pick a functional programming language other than Haskell and write a small
   but non-trivial (up to your own interpretation) program in it.
