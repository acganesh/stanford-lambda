## Problem

This week's homework is to extend a parser and interpreter for a simple
calculator language. The starter code, which describes the initial language
and provides an interpreter and parser, can be found
[here](https://gitlab.com/stanford-lambda/stanford-lambda.gitlab.io/tree/master/starter-code/assignment4).

The homework is simply to extend the language by modifying the code; no new
functions need to be written. As currently implemented, the language parses and
interprets expressions like the following.

```
1
(- 4)
(+ 1 2)
(+ (-5) (* 1 2))
```

You should extend the parsers, language datatype, and interpreter to
allow one or more arguments to `+` and `*` instead of exactly two.
