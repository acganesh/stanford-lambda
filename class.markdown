Course description: This course explores the philosophy and fundamentals of functional programming, with a focus on the Haskell and Clojure programming languages. Topics include: functional abstractions (function composition, higher order functions), immutable data structures, type systems, Lisp macros, homoiconicity, and monads. The course interleaves a theoretical description of fundamentals with hands-on projects in Haskell and Clojure.
