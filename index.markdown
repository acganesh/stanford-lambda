title: CS43 Notes
subtitle: Functional Programming Abstractions
---

These notes form an introductory course on functional programming using the
Haskell programming language, based on Stanford's CS43. They are intended to
briefly present the necessary syntax and basic concepts (which are covered
elsewhere in much greater depth) and focus on further theoretical exposition and
examples. They are written by Adithya Ganesh and Isaac Scheinfeld, under the
advising of Jerry Cain.  Special thanks to Allan Jiang, co-creator of CS43.

Note that since this is the first year this material is being taught in CS43,
this page will be updated throughout the course with new material.
