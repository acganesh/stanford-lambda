## General Info

This course explores the philosophy and fundamentals of functional programming, focusing on the Haskell language, its theoretical underpinnings, and practical
applications. Topics include: functional abstractions
(function composition, higher order functions), immutable data structures, type
systems, and various functional design patters (monads, etc). 

- Lectures: Mon / Wed: 4:30pm - 5:50pm, in Building 200, Room 030.
- Instructors: Adithya Ganesh and Isaac Scheinfeld
- Advisor: Jerry Cain
- Office Hours: By appointment, with scheduled times TBD.

## Resources

There is no formal textbook, but we recommend the Haskell wikibook as a primary reference.  A larger compilation of resources can be found [here](/resources.html).

- [Assignment 4](/assignments/assign4.html) (out: 2/7, due: 2/15). Solutions [here](/solutions/assign4.html).
- [Assignment 5](/assignments/assign5.html) (out: 2/20, due: 2/27).
- [Assignment 6](/assignments/assign6.html) (out: 3/5, due: 3/12).

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites, but we recommend "programming and mathematical maturity."  In terms of Stanford courses, CS107 + CS103 or equivalent experience will suffice.

## Expectations

To pass the class (graded C/NC), we expect:

1. Attendance in $\ge$ 80% of lectures.
2. Successful completion of $\ge 5/7$ assignments, which are designed to take around an hour each.

We also welcome open source contributions to the course materials; we will offer extra credit for this on a case-by-case basis to replace assignments.
