## General Info

This course covers the fundamentals of functional programming and algebraic type
systems, and explores a selection of modern programming paradigms and current
research in these areas. [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is taught and used
throughout the course, though much of the material is applicable to other
languages.  Topics will be covered from both theoretical and practical points of
view, and will include higher order functions, immutable data structures,
algebraic data types, type inference, lenses and optics, effect systems,
concurrency and parallelism, and dependent types.

- Lectures: Tue / Thu: 4:30pm - 5:50pm, in Building 200, Room 030
- Instructors: Isaac Scheinfeld, Adithya Ganesh, Patrick DeMichele
- Advisor: Jerry Cain
- Office Hours: TBD, twice weekly

## Resources

There is no formal textbook. [Lecture notes](/notes.html) will be released at least a week before
material is covered in class. A list of resources can be found [here](/resources.html), and will be
updated with additional material as the class progresses. We recommend the [Haskell wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
and [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) as primary free references.

## Assignments

Assignments will be posted here. They will generally be biweekly, and the intent
is to provide sufficient starter to make developing practical software
possible. Probable assignments include:

- Fractal Art Generator
- Interpreters for simple languages, up to a full Scheme implementation
- Simple Web Server

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites, but we recommend "programming and
mathematical maturity."  In terms of Stanford courses, CS107 + CS103 or
equivalent experience will suffice, though the material in those courses 
will not be relied upon.

This course intends to cover a lot of material, and depending on background some
topics may be more easily accessible than others. However, the aim is to provide
enough background in class for everyone to master the basics of Haskell, and
enough flexibility for people to focus on more theoretical or applied problems
depending on personal interest.

## Expectations

To pass the class (graded C/NC), we expect:

1. Attendance in $\ge$ 80% of lectures. There will be in-class exercises to
   attempt before working them out as a class, so students should bring a laptop.
2. Successful completion of the assignments. Submission deadlines will not be
   enforced but all work must be completed by the end of the quarter. Solutions
   will be available upon submission.

## Accessibility

We as a course staff are dedicated to making this course accessible to everyone.
Please let us know if you have any OAE accommodations or if we can do anything
to make the course materials and presentation more accessible. Also, feel free
to reach out with any personal questions or concerns about the course. We are always open
to making changes!

We would also like to acknowledge that the Haskell community is
extremely male dominated and the language has a reputation for being
a generally inaccessible "ivory tower" language.
Although we do not expect to solve this problem on our own, we are doing our
best to make Haskell accessible to everyone regardless of background or
identity. Please do not hesitate to point out where we can do better in this
regard.
