## General Info

This course covers the fundamentals of functional programming and algebraic type
systems, and explores a selection of modern programming paradigms and current
research in these areas. [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is taught and used
throughout the course, though much of the material is applicable to other
languages.  Topics will be covered from both theoretical and practical points of
view, and will include higher order functions, immutable data structures,
algebraic data types, type inference, lenses and optics, effect systems,
concurrency and parallelism, and dependent types.

- Lectures: Mon / Wed: 4:30pm - 5:50pm, in Building 200, Room 030.
- Instructors: Adithya Ganesh and Isaac Scheinfeld
- Advisor: Jerry Cain
- Office Hours: By appointment, with scheduled times TBD.

## Resources

There is no formal textbook, but we recommend the [Haskell wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)
and [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) as primary references.
A larger compilation of resources can be found [here](/resources.html). Lecture
notes will be uploaded over the duration of the course.

## Assignments

- [Assignment 1](/assignments/assign1.html) (out: 1/6, due: 1/13).

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites, but we recommend "programming and
mathematical maturity."  In terms of Stanford courses, CS107 + CS103 or
equivalent experience will suffice, though the material in those courses 
will not be relied upon.

This course intends to cover a lot of material, and depending on background some
topics may be more easily accessible than others. However, the aim is to provide
enough background in class for everyone to master the basics of Haskell, and
enough flexibility for people to focus on more theoretical or applied problems
depending on personal interest.

## Expectations

To pass the class (graded C/NC), we expect:

1. Attendance in $\ge$ 80% of lectures.
2. Successful completion of $\ge 6/8$ assignments, which are designed to take around an hour each.

We also welcome open source contributions to the course materials; we will offer credit for this on a case-by-case basis.
