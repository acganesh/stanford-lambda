## General Info

This course explores the philosophy and fundamentals of functional programming,
focusing on the Haskell language, its theoretical underpinnings, and practical
applications. Topics include: functional abstractions
(function composition, higher order functions), immutable data structures, type
systems, and various functional design patters (monads, etc). 

- Lectures: Mon / Wed: 4:30pm - 5:50pm, in Building 200, Room 030.
- Instructors: Adithya Ganesh and Isaac Scheinfeld
- Advisor: Jerry Cain
- Office Hours: By appointment, with scheduled times TBD.

## Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites, but we recommend "programming maturity" at
the level of CS107.

## Expectations

To pass the class (graded C/NC), we expect:

1. Attendance in $\ge$ 80% of lectures.
2. Successful completion of $\ge 6/8$ assignments, which should take no more than
   an hour each.

We also welcome open source contributions to the course materials; we will offer
extra credit for this on a case-by-case basis to replace assignments and/or
attendance.
