title: Lecture Notes
subtitle: Functional Programming Abstractions
---

These notes form an introductory course on functional programming using the
Haskell programming language, based on Stanford's CS43. They are intended to
briefly present the necessary syntax and basic concepts (which are covered
elsewhere in much greater depth) and focus on further theoretical exposition and
examples. They are written by Adithya Ganesh and Isaac Scheinfeld, under the
advising of Jerry Cain.  Special thanks to Allan Jiang, co-creator of CS43.

Note that since this is the first year this material is being taught in CS43,
this page will be updated throughout the course with new material.

## Background and Basics

1. [Why Haskell?](notes/Why_Haskell.html): An overview of Haskell's defining
   features, with brief examples.
   
1. [Getting Set Up](notes/Getting_Set_Up.html): One way to set up a Haskell environment with stack, as well
   as some options for minimal tooling.

1. [Introduction to Haskell](notes/Introduction_to_Haskell.html): Expressions, values, and
   types.

1. Algebraic Datatypes: Defining and using types in Haskell, and the basics of
   type algebra.

1. Functional Design Patterns: Recursion and list processing.

1. Typeclasses<!--[Typeclasses](notes/Typeclasses.html)-->: Using, writing, and
   deriving typeclasses, and the power of polymorphism.

## Type Design Patterns

1. Semigroup and Monoid<!--[Semigroup and
   Monoid](notes/Semigroup_and_Monoid.html)-->: Abstracting compositional
   structures.

1. Functor and Applicative<!--[Functor and Applicative](notes/Functor.html)-->:
   Lifting function application to a new level.

1. Monad<!--[Monad](notes/Monad.html)-->: It isn't *that* complicated.
